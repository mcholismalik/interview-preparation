   - ES6+ features (async await, arrow functions, etc)

3. Performance

   - Avoid blocking I/O with asynchronous code
   - Use 3rd platform like GCP/AWS
   - Use stateless authentication using jwt
   - Use stateless storage
   - Use socket.io for realtime request
   - Cluster the node
   - Execute with child process for computing

4. Test

   - Test with TDD
   - Use jest

5. Security

   - Adjust http headers (using helmet)
   - Limit concurrent request with express-rate-limit
   - Limit body payload size
   - Validate income JSON schema
   - Escape html, js, css output
