# Interview Preparation
There's some basic topic that you need to mastered for interview preparation as a Software Engineer

## Index
List of topic that you need to mastered for interview as a Software Engineer

1. Big O(n) Notation
2. Algorithm
3. Data Structure
4. Tech Stack
5. Design Pattern
6. Design System
7. Non Tech Interview

## 1. Big O(n) Notation
Concept to know how the complexity of the algorithm
- Base on input size grows
- Worst case scenario
- Count the operation not the time

1. O(1): Constant Time
    - Simple function
    - Loop 1 condition
2. O(log n): Logaritmic Time
    - Binary Search
3. O(n): Linear Time
    - Linear Search
4. O(n log n): Linearitmic Time
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
5. O(n^2): Quadric Time 
    - Bubble Sort
6. O(2^n): Exponential Time
    - Fibbonaci
7. O(!n): Factorial Time
    - Factorial

## 5. Programming Language
Choose 1 or more programming language, and deep dive into it

1. What ?
    - NodeJS is dynamic/static typed backend language that use google v8 chrome engine & libuv library
    - Golang is static typed backend language that inherit obreon & syntax from C

2. Why ?
    - Simple syntax
    - Fast Development
    - High performance
    - Scalable

3. How ?
    - NodeJS operates on a single thread, asynchronous, non-blocking I/O
    - Golang built in concurrenty with goroutine

4. When ?
    - Handle huge concurrent request
    - Not heavy computation

5. Where ?
    - Realtime app
    - Queued input
    - Streaming

## 6. Coding 
Simple case to improve coding skill, create crud sample in json local  
- Read list json
- Filter slice, by date
- Sort slice, by date
- Append list json
