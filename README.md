# Interview Preparation
There's some basic topic that you need to mastered for interview preparation as a Software Engineer

## Index
List of topic that you need to mastered for interview as a Software Engineer

1. Big O(n) Notation
2. Algorithm
3. Data Structure
4. Tech Stack
5. System Design
6. Design Pattern
7. Non Tech Interview

## 1. Big O(n) Notation
Concept to know how the complexity of the algorithm
- Base on input size grows
- Worst case scenario
- Count the operation not the time

1. O(1): Constant Time
    - Simple function
    - Loop 1 condition
2. O(log n): Logaritmic Time
    - Binary Search
3. O(n): Linear Time
    - Linear Search
4. O(n log n): Linearitmic Time
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
5. O(n^2): Quadric Time 
    - Bubble Sort
6. O(2^n): Exponential Time
  - Fibbonaci
7. O(!n): Factorial Time
  - Factorial

## 2. Algorithm
Basic problem solving way in some case

1. Recursion
2. Search
  1. Linear Search
  2. Binary Search
  3. Breadth First Search
  4. Depth First Search
3. Sort
  1. Bubble Sort
  2. Merge Sort
  3. Quick Sort

## 3. Data Structure
Standar data structure in some programming language

1. Linear (Sequencial manner)
  1. Array
  2. Linked List
    1. Single Linked List
    2. Double Linked List
    3. Circular Linked List
  3. Queue 
  4. Stack
2. Non Linear (Hierarchial manner)
  1. Trees
  2. Heap
  3. Tries
  4. Hash table

## 4. TechStack
Choose 1 or more stack, and deep dive into it

1. What ?
  - NodeJS is dynamic/static typed backend language that use google v8 chrome engine & libuv library
  - Golang is static typed backend language that inherit obreon & syntax from C

2. Why ?
  - Simple syntax
  - Fast Development
  - High performance
  - Scalable

3. How ?
  - NodeJS operates on a single thread, asynchronous, non-blocking I/O
  - Golang built in concurrenty with goroutine

4. When ?
  - Handle huge concurrent request
  - Not heavy computation

5. Where ?
  - Realtime app
  - Queued input
  - Streaming

## 5. Design System

1. Design Pattern
   - OOP Paradigm
   - SOLID Principle
   - Clean Architecture

2. Performance
  - NodeJS
    - Avoid blocking I/O with asynchronous code
    - Execute with child process for computing
  - Golang
    - Use pointer to reduce memory
    - Stay concurrency with goroutine

3. Test
   - Add unit test in each layer
   - Add mocky in each unit test

4. Security
  - Authentication with JWT
  - Authorization with Role based map to each route
  - Use DTO validate request schema
  - Use ORM prevent sql injection
  - Use Constraint to handle db rules

## 6. Design Patten

1. OOP Paradigm
  1. Abstraction
  2. Inheritance
  3. Encaptulation
  4. Polymorphism
2. SOLID Princple
  1. Single Responsibility
  2. Open Closed
  3. Liskov Subtitution
  4. Interface Segregation
  5. Dependency Inversion
3. Clean Architecture
  1. Entity
  2. Usecase / service
  3. Controller / handler
  4. External Interface

## 7. Non Tech Interview
